Hi Henrik,
I can see that a German colleague has shared a document with Simon Eder in the case you mention. 
Given the contents of the document, I don't see any harm in sharing it, especially given that 
technically that same information is obtained when you view any dbc in notepad.
I should add that it is intended for internal use and is not prepared for customer use. 
We do not recommend working with dbc files this way, but if you want to, you may. 
However, we can probably not assist with unexpected behaviors if they occur.
Please note that this is a Vector internal document and you are not allowed to forward the format 
description to third parties outside of your company.
 
Regards
