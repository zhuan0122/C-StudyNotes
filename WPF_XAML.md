    * Windoes Presentation Foundation(WPF) is a UI framework and it is built to take advantage of mordern graphic
    hardware. WPF provides a comprehensive set of application-development features that include Extensive Application 
    Markup langaugge(XAML), controls, data binding, layout, 2D or 3D graphics, animations, styles, templates,...

    * WPF is part of .NET, so you can build applications that incorporate other elements of .NET API. 
    .NET framework is exclucively for windows while .NET core is for various operating sytem. 
    
    * follow the link above to get a overview how is that working. XML basics are requiered to work with WPF 
      XAML is XML based markup langaugge that inplements an application's apperance decalaratively
      Since XAML is XML-based, the UI that you compose with it's assembled in a hierarchy of nested elements that is known as an element tree.
       The element tree provides a logical and intuitive way to create and manage UIs.

       XAML + code behind

       what is code behind and what is this for? : Then main behaviour of an application is to implement 
       the functionality that responds to user interactions. so if the user click the button, it this will call
       businees logic and data access logic in response in behind. since we have our code behind to support it. 

       In WPF, this behaviour is implemented in code that is associated with markup. This type of code is known-as 
       code behind.
