EN:
I created an new branch locally called task1_name when I checked out in local develop branch. 1. git checkout develop 2. git branch task1_name
then push the local task1_name branch to remote and the remote mapping branch task1_name is created automatically by follwing command 
git push -u --set-upstream origin task1_name 

this origin task1_name is another subbranch same as origin/develop versus origin main. 
so this task1_name is not sync with origin develop. It only has contents as main has. could I say it is created from main? even I created locally after I checked out in develop local branch. ??
