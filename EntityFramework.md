1. what is Entity Framework? 
   Entity framework is short for EF. EF simplifies mapping between objects in your software to the tables and columns of a relational database.

   * It enables developers to work with data using objects of domain-specific classes without focusing on the underlying database tables    and    columns where this data is stored.
    * It takes care of creating database connections and executing commands, as well as taking query results and automatically      materializing those results as your application objects.
*   It also helps to keep track of changes to those objects, and when instructed, it will also persist those changes back to the database for you.
