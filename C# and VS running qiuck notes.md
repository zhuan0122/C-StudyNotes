*  one class could be one .cs file under the same namespace along with other classes(.cs files) so one namespace would be one application.  

* Refactor: change the structure of the code without changing its functionality Â¨

*  we should not use pulic as modifier for calsses fileds so I need to learn more about when and how to use these scope modifiers.

* run in debug mode with break point
    move your mouse to the line you want to set break point and then F7-- set break point here 
    then F5 to run it with debug mode 
    when we set breakpoint then the running will excute the breakpoint line and stop there and show our data

    shift + F5 stop the debug mode-, F7 remove current break point
